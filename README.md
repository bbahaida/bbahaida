## About me
I’m a Senior Software Engineer and DevOps practitioner with **7+ years** of experience designing cloud applications, building secure CI/CD pipelines, and teaching cloud & DevOps topics. I combine production engineering (microservices, Kubernetes, CI/CD, observability) with hands-on teaching experience to help teams ship reliable, secure software faster.

Key strengths:
- Designing and implementing CI/CD pipelines and DevOps workflows
- Cloud orchestration and microservices on AWS + Kubernetes
- DevSecOps and SOC tooling (Wazuh, TheHive) and monitoring stacks
- Teaching and curriculum design for DevOps / Cloud courses
